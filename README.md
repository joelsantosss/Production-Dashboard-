# Production Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a comprehensive **Production Dashboard** in Excel that provides key insights into production costs, output, and management tasks. The dashboard was developed through several stages including data understanding, cleansing, transformation, and visualization.

## Steps & Methodology

1. **Data Understanding & Cleansing**  
   - Explored raw data to understand structure and content  
   - Removed data quality issues using Excel functions such as `VLOOKUP` to correct mismatches and fill missing values  

2. **Data Transformation**  
   - Added calculated columns:  
     - **Age Group** for categorizing data by production age  
     - **Production Cost per Unit** to analyze cost efficiency  
   - Cleaned and structured data to enable accurate analysis  

3. **Visualization Creation**  
   - Designed multiple 3D charts for visual insights:  
     - 3D Column Chart  
     - 3D Bar Chart  
     - 3D Line Chart  
     - 3D Pie Chart  

4. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Compiled the charts and key metrics into a cohesive Excel dashboard for easy interpretation and decision-making
